A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Sambego/pen/xZZRja.

 This is a proof of concept for a web based Siri interface. This poc relies on some experimental browser api's (web-speech-api) which is currently only supported by Chrome. Make sure you allow the browser to access your microphone. The speech-api stops listening after 60 seconds, this is a built-in limitation.

Try saying something to Siri, it's already listening! It may take some time for Siri to recognise or respond to your question, everything you say is sent to google servers to be analysed.

Some of the commands:

- My name is {{your name}}
- Are you on twitter?
- Where are you from?
- Can you beatbox?
