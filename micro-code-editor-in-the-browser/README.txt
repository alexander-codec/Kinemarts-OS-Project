A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/BlueSky1021/pen/ZGvwVJ.

 No CodeMirror nor tons of files and weighty functions. This editor is made using only a little of CSS+JavaScript and the awesome Prism.js plugin for highlight!

Perfect fit for landing pages or when you want the user to edit or play with small pieces of code.

Forked from [Claudio Holanda](http://codepen.io/kazzkiq/)'s Pen [Micro Code Editor in the Browser!](http://codepen.io/kazzkiq/pen/xGXaKR/).
